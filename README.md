Your README documentation is already quite thorough, but I can help you improve it further by adding more structure, clarifying certain sections, and adding additional tips and best practices. Here's an improved version:

# ZenoPay-Card-Php
### ZenoPay Card API Integration

## Overview

The ZenoPay Card API allows you to seamlessly integrate card payment functionality into your application. This API enables you to create and process payment transactions by sending buyer details, transaction amount, and a unique account identifier. The API will process the payment and return a response that indicates the success or failure of the transaction.

This repository contains a simple PHP implementation for interacting with the ZenoPay Card API, making it easy to integrate card payment services into your PHP-based applications.


Note: All amounts should be provided in TZS (Tanzanian Shillings).

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0 or higher
- cURL extension enabled in PHP
- An active ZenoPay account to obtain API access credentials

Ensure that your PHP environment meets the following prerequisites:

1. PHP 7.0 or higher is required for compatibility with modern API features.
2. The cURL extension must be enabled to send HTTP requests to the ZenoPay API.

To check if cURL is installed and enabled, you can run:

```bash
php -m | grep curl
```

If the `curl` module is not installed, you can install it. On Ubuntu, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-curl
```

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository or download the `zenopay-card-api` folder to your project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZenoPay/ZenoPay-Card-Php.git
```

### Step 2: Enable cURL Extension in PHP

Ensure that the cURL extension is enabled. If you're using Ubuntu, you can install it as follows:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-curl
```

For other systems, follow the appropriate method to enable cURL.

### Step 3: Configure API Credentials

Open the provided PHP example file and update the `buyer_name`, `buyer_phone`, `buyer_email`, `amount`, and `account_id` fields with the correct data. Youâ€™ll need to replace these values with real buyer information and the unique account ID provided by ZenoPay.

## API Documentation

### Endpoint

The ZenoPay Card API endpoint is:

```
POST https://api.zeno.africa/card
```

### Request Format

To initiate a payment transaction, send a **POST** request to the API with a JSON payload that includes the following parameters:

| Parameter        | Type    | Description                                        | Example               |
|------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `buyer_name`     | string  | Full name of the buyer                             | `"John Doe"`          |
| `buyer_phone`    | string  | Phone number of the buyer                          | `"+254712345678"`     |
| `buyer_email`    | string  | Email address of the buyer                         | `"johndoe@example.com"`|
| `amount`         | float   | Amount to be paid by the buyer in the transaction  | `150.00`              |
| `account_id`     | string  | Unique account identifier for the transaction      | `"acc_12345xyz"`      |
| `redirect_url`   | string  | URL to redirect to after successful payment        | `"https://example.com/success"` |
| `cancel_url`     | string  | URL to redirect to if the payment is cancelled     | `"https://example.com/cancel"`  |

**Note:** All fields are required unless otherwise specified.

### Response Format

The API responds with a JSON object. A successful response looks like this:

```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "transaction_id": "txn_abc123xyz",
    "message": "Payment processed successfully",
    "data": {
        "buyer_name": "John Doe",
        "buyer_phone": "+254712345678",
        "buyer_email": "johndoe@example.com",
        "amount": 150.00,
        "account_id": "acc_12345xyz"
    }
}
```

#### Response Parameters

| Parameter         | Type    | Description                                               | Example                     |
|-------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `status`          | string  | The status of the transaction (`success` or `failure`)    | `"success"`                 |
| `transaction_id`  | string  | The unique transaction identifier                         | `"txn_abc123xyz"`           |
| `message`         | string  | A message describing the result of the transaction        | `"Payment processed successfully"` |
| `data`            | object  | The transaction data that was sent with the request       | See example above           |

### Error Handling

If there's an issue with the request or the processing of the transaction, the response might look like:

```json
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Invalid account_id"
}
```

#### Error Parameters

| Parameter    | Type   | Description                            | Example                     |

| `status`     | string | The error status (`error`)             | `"error"`                   |
| `message`    | string | A description of the error             | `"Invalid account_id"`      |

## PHP Example Code

The following PHP code demonstrates how to interact with the ZenoPay Card API.

```php
<?php

// ZenoPay API endpoint
$url = 'https://api.zeno.africa/card';

// Data to be sent in the POST request
$data = array(
    'buyer_name'   => 'John Doe',
    'buyer_phone'  => '+254712345678',
    'buyer_email'  => 'johndoe@example.com',
    'amount'       => 15000,
    'account_id'   => 'acc_12345xyz',
    'redirect_url' => 'https://example.com/success',
    'cancel_url'   => 'https://example.com/cancel',
);

// Convert the data array to JSON
$jsonData = json_encode($data);

// Initialize cURL session
$ch = curl_init($url);

// Set the necessary cURL options
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);  // Return the response as a string
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);  // HTTP POST method
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $jsonData);  // Attach the JSON data

// Set the request headers (Content-Type and Accept)
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array(
    'Content-Type: application/json',  // Indicate that we are sending JSON data
    'Accept: application/json'         // Expecting a JSON response
));

// Execute the POST request and get the response
$response = curl_exec($ch);

// Check if cURL encountered any errors
if(curl_errno($ch)) {
    echo 'Error:' . curl_error($ch);
    exit;
}

// Close the cURL session
curl_close($ch);

// Decode the JSON response into an associative array
$responseData = json_decode($response, true);

// Output the response (for debugging purposes)
echo '<pre>';
print_r($responseData);
echo '</pre>';

?>
```

### How to Use the Example

1. **Edit the Parameters**: Modify the `buyer_name`, `buyer_phone`, `buyer_email`, `amount`, `account_id`, `redirect_url`, and `cancel_url` fields in the `$data` array with your own test data or real data from your application.
   
2. **Run the Script**: Upload the script to a server that supports PHP and has cURL enabled. Then, execute it via a browser or a command-line tool to make the POST request to the ZenoPay API.

3. **View the Response**: After executing the script, the response from the API will be printed. If the transaction is successful, it will contain transaction details. Otherwise, it will include error information.

## Final Thoughts

This guide provides an easy-to-follow approach to integrating ZenoPay Card API into your PHP-based applications. With this integration, you can begin processing payments securely and efficiently. Always ensure that the `amount`, `buyer_email`, and other parameters are properly sanitized and validated in your production environment to prevent security issues.
